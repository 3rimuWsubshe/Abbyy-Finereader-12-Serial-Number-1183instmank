# Data Collection Policy

At `llama-github`, we are committed to protecting the privacy and security of our users. This document outlines our data collection policy and explains how we handle user data within the library.

## Data Collection

`llama-github` is an open-source Python library designed to empower LLM Chatbots, AI Agents, and Auto-dev Agents by retrieving relevant context from GitHub repositories. We want to emphasize that `llama-github` does not collect or store any user data.

The library operates entirely locally within the developer's application and does not transmit or store any data externally. This means that sensitive information such as access tokens, API keys, user queries, and retrieved contexts remain solely within the confines of the library and the developer's application.

## Data Handling

When using `llama-github`, developers are responsible for securely handling and storing any sensitive data required for the library's functionality. This includes:

- GitHub access tokens
- GitHub App credentials
- OpenAI API keys
- Hugging Face tokens
- Jina API keys
- User queries
- Retrieved contexts

Developers should follow best practices for securely storing and managing these credentials and data within their own applications. `llama-github` does not have access to or collect any of this information.

## Third-Party Services

`llama-github` may integrate with third-party services such as GitHub, OpenAI, Hugging Face, and Jina AI for retrieving data and leveraging their APIs. However, the library itself does not collect or store any data from these services. The interactions with these services are handled directly by the developer's application, and it is the developer's responsibility to ensure compliance with the respective terms of service and data privacy policies of these third-party services.

## Data Retention

As `llama-github` does not collect any user data, there is no data retention policy in place. The library does not store or retain any data beyond the scope of the developer's application.

## Changes to the Data Collection Policy

In the event that `llama-github` introduces any changes to its data collection practices in future versions, we will update this policy accordingly. We recommend periodically reviewing this document to stay informed about any changes.
